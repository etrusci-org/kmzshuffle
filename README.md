# kmzshuffle

Shuffle randomize the order of placemark's in a folder from [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com) kmz files.

The original file won't be touched. E.g. if your input file is foo.kmz, the output will be named foo_shuffled.kmz.

**Why**: In Google Earth you can only sort a folder with placemarks by A-Z but not randomize the order. This is my quick solution. Didn't test it much - it works with the files I have and it should also with yours.

You can test with the example files in the [doc directory](./doc).

**Also**: Python's built-in xml module is not my friend, so there you have the answer if the method to accomplish the task irritates you ðŸ‘½
